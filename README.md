# Todoey_App
  A simple to-do list app that can add new tasks, mark off tasks and delete tasks in a simple layout. In this app I learned how to manage State with the Provider Package. I used ChangeNotifier to Manage State across the app. I implemented ListView widgets to create the layout of the app.  BottomSheet widget is used for the add tasks pop up menu.
